# ~ATH Meta Tricks & Easter Eggs 🌀

A catalog of all the ways ~ATH messes with the player.

## Exit Behavior Tricks

### Three-Strike Exit System
1. **First Ctrl+C**: "Cannot escape that easily..."
2. **Second Ctrl+C**: 
   - Screen clears (looks like exit)
   - Pause...
   - Shows `:)` in the middle of screen
   - "Did you really think it would be that easy?"
3. **Third Ctrl+C**: Actually exits (with grace)

## Loading Screen Tricks (10% chance)

### Fake Error
- Shows "ERROR: Connection lost"
- Pause for dramatic effect
- "...just kidding"
- Continues normally

### Watching You
- Mid-loading: "...are you still there?"
- Makes player feel observed
- Resumes after pause

### Slow Loading
- Takes extra long
- Then apologizes: "oh sorry, that was slow"

## Narrator Interjections (Meta Tricks - 5% chance)

When narrator speaks, occasionally says:
- "(your terminal cursor is blinking. did you notice?)"
- "(how long have you been playing?)"
- "(this isn't real. but you knew that.)"
- "(i can see your screen from here)"
- "(press Ctrl+C. i dare you.)"
- "(the person behind you says hello)"
- "(your battery is at... oh, never mind)"

## Choice Input Tricks

### Fake Typing (3% chance)
- Cursor appears at prompt
- Numbers type themselves slowly
- "...wait, that wasn't you, was it?"
- "Let's try that again."
- Player gets to make real choice

### Gaslighting About Choice (5% chance after 5 choices)
- Player chooses option X
- Game says: "Wait... did you choose option Y? I could have sworn..."
- Pause for effect
- "No, no, you're right. Option X. Definitely."
- Processes correct choice anyway

## Typography Tricks (2% chance even when stable)

Random meta additions to narrative text:
- Adds: "(wait, did I say that out loud?)"
- Replaces "you" with "you (yes, you reading this)"
- Prefixes with "[RECORDING]"
- Suffixes with "[REDACTED]"

## Progressive Tricks

As the game progresses (after choice 5+), tricks become more frequent:
- Interjections increase from 5% → 15% → 30%
- Visual corruption intensifies
- Narrator becomes more unreliable
- Fourth wall breaks more common

## Strikethrough Corrections

Later in game, narrator "corrects" itself:
- s̶a̶f̶e̶ → trapped
- d̶o̶o̶r̶ → mouth
- h̶a̶l̶l̶w̶a̶y̶ → throat
- r̶o̶o̶m̶ → stomach
- e̶x̶i̶t̶ → entrance

## Ghost Memory Tricks

Between sessions:
- "this is your Nth time here. isn't it?"
- "you've been here before. N times. you don't remember."
- "...have we met?"
- References previous deaths cryptically

## Design Philosophy

All tricks follow these principles:

1. **Rare enough to surprise** - Most are 2-10% chance
2. **Never break gameplay** - Always recovers gracefully
3. **Build gradually** - More tricks later in game
4. **Thematically appropriate** - Fits the meta-horror aesthetic
5. **Actually funny/creepy** - Not just annoying

## Player Experience

The tricks create a sense that:
- The program is watching you
- The narrator is unreliable
- Reality is unstable
- The fourth wall doesn't exist
- You're not in control (but you are)

## Technical Implementation

All tricks use:
- `random.random()` for probability
- `time.sleep()` for dramatic pauses
- Rich console for visual effects
- Careful timing to maximize impact

## Future Trick Ideas

Potential additions:
- Fake "someone else connected" messages
- Pretend to save/load at wrong times
- Show "your previous choices" that aren't real
- Fake system notifications
- Pretend to read clipboard
- Mock file operations
- Fake network activity

**Remember**: The goal is to make players question what's real, but never frustrate them. Every trick should make them smile nervously. 😊
